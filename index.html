      <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage! I am currently a Paralegal and learning Web Development as a side hobby to keep my mind sharp and challenged. My legal expertise includes Civil Litigation, Contracts, Real Estate, Trusts, and Wills.</p>

      <p>I obtained a dual Bachelor of Arts in Legal Studies and Sociology in June of 2011 from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a postgraduate certificate in Paralegal Studies from the University of California, Irvine.</p>

      <p>In the near future, I am interesting in taking my Legal career further in addition to Web Development to become a multi-talented and skilled professional.</p>
